When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with a team or using multiple computers to complete your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it may do it at a time when you are part way through a commit or where a commit is not logical.
