QUESTION 1

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You need to initialize so that git can see what files it needs to track. But I don't think it automatically starts tracking them. Looks liek you need to "git add" files...


QUESTION 2

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It allows you to group changes logically to many file insterad of one for easier tracking...
